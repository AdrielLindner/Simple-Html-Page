# Simple-Html-Page
Very simple code, but it helped me with basic concepts of HTML, also implementing CSS and JS.

 *General summary of what I learned from this code:*
 1. How to download the necessary tools for web development and customize the editor with packages.
 2. I created a project directory to build a website.
 3. I created a title and other elements for the page, linked external files, and tested the page in the browser.
 4. I applied styles to different elements.
 5. I added support for light/dark themes using CSS.
 6. I added JavaScript to enable personalized interaction with the page and switch between themes.
 7. I learned how to create a console message.
